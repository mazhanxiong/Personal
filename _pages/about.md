This is **Zhanxiong Ma**, a fifth-year PhD student in [the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at KAIST](https://civil.kaist.ac.kr/). I am currently studing in [Smart Structures and Systems Laboratory (SSSLAB)](http://ssslab.kaist.ac.kr/main/main.html) under the supervison of [Professor Hoon Sohn](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=1_kv8AkAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Bachelor’s Degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2014, and Master’s Degree from [Chongqing University (CQU)](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) in 2017.

My research interests lie in the general area of strcural health monitoring, particularly in **structural displacement estimation using data-fusion techniques and computer vision algorithms**.
