Studying as a fifth-year PhD student in the department of civil and environmental engineering at KAIST, I am currently in Smart Structures and Systems Laboratory (SSSLAB) supervised by Professor Hoon Sohn. I received my Bachelor’s Degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2014, and Master’s Degree from Chongqing University (CQU) in 2017.

My research interests lie in the general area of strcural health monitoring, particularly in data fusion based structural response estimation.

More info about me can be found in [my cv](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/).
